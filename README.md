spsx  (spaceport sound exchange)
================================

This is an audio file format conversion tool.  
Use this to decode mp3 files and encode as ogg vorbis. 

Note: This does not use any mp3 decoder library or any mp3 decoder source code.  
For mp3, this uses the operating system supplied APIs for decoding media.


Build Instructions:
 - all code dependencies are included in this repository.
 - just open the project in your favorite C++ IDE and compile.
 - everything is statically linked as much as possible.
 - deploy the command line executable as needed.
